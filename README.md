# Binary to Decimal Converter in C

This is a simple C program that converts a binary number (input as a string) to its decimal (base-10) equivalent.

I wrote this as a beginner to practice working with strings, loops, and basic number conversion logic in C.
Im trying to become an embedded engineer and learning C as my programming language and im trying to answer different kind of questions for improving my C logic implementation

## 🧪 Example

```
Input: 1011  
Output: 11
```

---

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

### Compile:
```bash
gcc converter.c -o converter
```

### Run:
```bash
./converter
```

(Replace `converter.c` with your actual file name if it's different.)

## 💬 What I'm Looking For

I'm still learning C and programming in general. I'd love feedback or suggestions on:

- Is my logic correct and efficient?
- Are there better ways to handle string input and conversion?
- How can I make my code cleaner or more readable?
- Am I following good C programming practices?
- Any improvements or alternate methods?

Feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/mdishauq/binarytodecimal/issues) or leave a comment in the code!

## ✅ Features
- Converts binary numbers (as strings) to decimal.
- Simple terminal-based input/output.
- Beginner-friendly structure.

---

## 🧠 Notes
- Input must be a valid binary number (only 0s and 1s).
- The program does not yet validate malformed input — feel free to suggest how to add that!
